Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.


What I did:

This Poppi is not much different from original release. Some minor rigging issues has been fixed this time without custom intervention, though unlike last release
texture resolution doubled in size.
