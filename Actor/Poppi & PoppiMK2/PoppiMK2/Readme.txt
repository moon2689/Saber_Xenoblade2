Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.


What I did:

PoppiMK2 is essentially Poppi with a reskin. There is very slight differences, so just in case I made sure to use the armature that came from PoppiMK2.
poppiBuster and MK2, even the weapon where all in 1 file. I seperated them in hopes of making it simplier, but some textures did share the functions of others
expesially in the Temp maps, so please make sure you look at all temp map channels.


Texture Notes:

It felt as if MK2 was a rush job, and I was unsure if it was styalistic or not, but with glaring issues, I figured to fix them. Edited textures serve to wash away the missed blues
on her hair, fix shoddy paint jobs, as well as fix other issues. If you do not desire them, just use the ones outside of "Edited". Since it just color edits, the temp did
not need to be edited, thankfully.
