 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
I notice that normals with anythign that has a morph would be lost. If you use 3DS MAX use my .max. If you use blender, use the .fbx. Do not import an fbx into max or maya else you will lose normal data. Do not
try to rexport with Noesis, else you'd lose other data such as UV2's and UV3's, ETC.

Most of my releases, expesially relating to most blades will have 2 new bones added to the skeleton which just does seperate left right eye blinks

~~~~ What I did:

I tried to do my best to maintain the Fur. The fur was done using a variation of displacement and/or some sort of fuzz shader. I pushed the mesh outwards so you can do the same thing with just opacity, but it may not be correct

~~~~ Texture Notes:

Nothing really to note
