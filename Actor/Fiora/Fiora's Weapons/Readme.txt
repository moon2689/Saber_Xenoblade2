 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!

The weapons appear to use a mirror tile, you must set the tiling to mirror on the edges if you want it to look right.

I have set an example in 3DS Max Material Editor. Unfortunately this does not translate to Blender well, so hopefully you know what mirror tiling is.
