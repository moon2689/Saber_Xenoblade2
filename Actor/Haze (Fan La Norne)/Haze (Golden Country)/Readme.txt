 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
I notice that normals with anythign that has a morph would be lost. If you use 3DS MAX use my .max. If you use blender, use the .fbx. Do not import an fbx into max or maya else you will lose normal data. Do not
try to rexport with Noesis, else you'd lose other data such as UV2's and UV3's, ETC.

~~~~ What I did:
Nothing, really. Have fun.

Nothing is probably changed in terms of mesh but textures are slightly different. Use this haze if you want the latest one from the Golden Country DLC.
