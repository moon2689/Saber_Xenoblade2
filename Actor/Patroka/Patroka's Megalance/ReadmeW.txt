I have found an dincluded many versions of the Lance of Origin (Patroka's weapon). Thats how its called in game. The Articulated one has lots of effects and rigged parts for animation, but if you are just
looking for a stock spear to use, the base is just as good, not many rigged parts and so forth.  Finally theres just the head of it, not to sure what that is used for.
