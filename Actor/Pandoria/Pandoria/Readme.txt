Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.


What I did:

Pandora has her cloak included. Just hide the hair if you want the cloak on, whilist using the cloak hair, and hide both cloak and cloak hair if you want it off. 
I also seperated the coils so you could have different glows for different parts. Seperated the hat too, as it was attatched to the body. It would of made hiding it as well
difficult to use with the cloak. Other edits include fixing UV issues on various part as well as combining meshs for simplicity and QoL.


Texture Notes:

Eyeglases is pretty much entirely shader based. There is no texture for it oddly enough. GRASS_COL might be responsible for the reflective shine, though, but I could be wrong.
