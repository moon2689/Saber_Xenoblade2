Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.


What I did:

PoppiBuster, MK2, even the weapon where all in 1 file. I seperated them in hopes of making it simplier, but some textures did share the functions of others
expesially in the Temp maps, so please make sure you look at all temp map channels. I seperated the flamehair into their parts for ease of use


Texture Notes:

His Hair uses the UVmaps speficied, atleast the general opacity. Its up to you to figure out how to make a shader that wobbles with the harsh flame
