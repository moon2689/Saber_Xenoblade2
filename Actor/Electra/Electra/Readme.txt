Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.


What I did:

Electra has these electric balls thing that float around her on the ring. They wernt there as they are now so I put them there along with their own bones for control.
They are billboarded to the camera at all times in game.

Texture Notes:

Electra's drumsticks are a 1-col off gold, copper color. Could even be wood.
