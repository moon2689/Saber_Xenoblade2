 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
Please use the appropriate file. These models where prepaired in 3DS Max 2018, so .max will be perfect for Autodesk Programs, otherwise, the FBX should work fine for blender. Re-importing the fbx into 3DS Max
might make the custom normals be lost, so do your work at your own descretion. 

~~~~ What I did:

I had to do alot to the cape and furs sorry. The game does use some sort of fur shader which I still am not sure how its done. Using other models as examples, i extruded fur mesh's into 2 layers which uses the fur opacity
however, if you can make your own shader that would probably be much better.

~~~~ Texture Notes:

Nothing really to note
