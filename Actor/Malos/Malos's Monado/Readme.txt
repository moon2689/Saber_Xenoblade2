As always with weapons, its a combination of masks and colors to create effects. BladeAURA_01_YGM as welll as BladeAura_02_YGM serves has crutch of the animation, and when used as an addition to 
BLADEAURA_01_ALP (or a custom flame mask) which is basically just a slightly flamey straight fire black and white mask. using the YGM textures as overlays or masking as well as animating them can allow the
overal mask to animate like a flame.

That shader is then used on multiple kinds of UV's on the sword, though figuring all that out is rather difficult, refer to in game examples or just try to get something that looks good, you can do it! I wont be able to help
much unfortunately.
