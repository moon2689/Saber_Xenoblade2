 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
I notice that normals with anythign that has a morph would be lost. If you use 3DS MAX use my .max. If you use blender, use the .fbx. Do not import an fbx into max or maya else you will lose normal data. Do not
try to rexport with Noesis, else you'd lose other data such as UV2's and UV3's, ETC.

~~~~ What I did:

Combine morphs together, Eyebrows and Face.

~~~~ Texture Notes:

Every other model has the eyebrows on the face. The eyebrows are shadeless and don't really produce any highlights in game, They use a similar shader to the face, and shulk + fiora are no exception. I made edits
to the textures to have the eyebrows on the face, just like every other model there is. It also combines all the Morphs in one place too, making it less confusing.
