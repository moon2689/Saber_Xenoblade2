 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
Please use the appropriate file. These models where prepaired in 3DS Max 2018, so .max will be perfect for Autodesk Programs, otherwise, the FBX should work fine for blender. Re-importing the fbx into 3DS Max
might make the custom normals be lost, so do your work at your own descretion. 

~~~~~~~~~
More often than not the edits I make revolve around Q.o.L. I only make changes I deem nessesary, either to adhere to a consistant pattern (that was broken for some strange reason) or to merge things
that have no need to be seperate, such as mouths, teeths to faces (if they have MANY morphs). I also add seperate blinks, since its super easy when it comes to bone based expressions. 

These edits are consistant through all releases and increase the overal quality of my releases, some edits are much harder to manage than others, but I do it to provide something easy to use. Please note
everything is as raw as can be still, I make sure never to needlessly change topology or the model it self unless absolutely neccesary.
