 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
I notice that normals with anythign that has a morph would be lost. If you use 3DS MAX use my .max. If you use blender, use the .fbx. Do not import an fbx into max or maya else you will lose normal data. Do not
try to rexport with Noesis, else you'd lose other data such as UV2's and UV3's, ETC.

~~~~ What I did:

Nothing really. Since PoppiQTpi uses bones instead of morphs, I didn't need to unify any buffer vertex or make sure morphs is merged as well.

~~~~ Texture Notes:

Nothing really to note, just be smart of how you do. Nose dot tends to be black while face dots tend to be white.
