 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
I notice that normals with anythign that has a morph would be lost. If you use 3DS MAX use my .max. If you use blender, use the .fbx. Do not import an fbx into max or maya else you will lose normal data. Do not
try to rexport with Noesis, else you'd lose other data such as UV2's and UV3's, ETC.

~~~~ What I did:

I merged the face strips and eyebrows to the face itself. I gave it its own normals as the face strips had them. They are uniform to the face anyways, as when you view QT's face in game, its not reflective or anything
of the sort. However, I did make seperate blink bones, its the easiest and simplist thing I can do.

~~~~ Texture Notes:

Nothing to note.
