Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.


What I did:

Same thing I do to most blades with just bones for facial expressions. Seperate blink bones for the added more control. I edited UV's to support glow. Eye Highlights also have
their own bone for seperate control.


Texture Notes:

BodyGlowStrips uses UV2 of the body texture for the blue glow color, otherwise UV1's provide skin color. Not to sure why its like that when I only remember it being glowing in game.
EarringsSilver and Red should be self explanitory.
