Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
I notice that normals with anythign that has a morph would be lost. I restored normals properly this time on faces, but please, if you use 3DS MAX use my .max.
If you use blender, use the .fbx. Do not import an fbx into max or maya else you will lose normal data.

~~~~ What I did:

Similar work to Mythra and Pyra, though I did fix the folded wings mesh. This is also a fresh export so most problems experienced with past releases wont happen here.

~~~~ Texture Notes:

Nothing really to note, just be smart of how you do. Nose dot tends to be black while face dots tend to be white.
