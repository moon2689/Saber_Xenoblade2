Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.


What I did:

For T-elos I had to create color textures, because otherwise mesh's where 1 col meshs without textures (or even UV's at some point)


Texture Notes:

Because of above, several things need to be noted.

LipGloss = Can use Eye texture for the whiteness
Eyeglasses =  is obviously a Grey transparent, and reflective glass texture, the edges are darker
HighlightsBluOpac = uses BL303101_EYEHighB texture in combination with the BL303101_EyeHighB_A texture as a mask. The long highlight on the lower end of her eye is meant to fade out in game
NoseDot = just uses a very dark bronw black color
GoldChain = uses Gold for its color, The BL303101_AOF is its opacity mask while BL303101_NORMALF is its normal
LeggingsAccent= uses Momo
