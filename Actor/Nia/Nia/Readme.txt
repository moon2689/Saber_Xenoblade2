 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
I notice that normals with anythign that has a morph would be lost. If you use 3DS MAX use my .max. If you use blender, use the .fbx. Do not import an fbx into max or maya else you will lose normal data. Do not
try to rexport with Noesis, else you'd lose other data such as UV2's and UV3's, ETC.

~~~~ What I did:

Nia was relatively normal. I did re-configure the elements of her mesh's to seperate the hair ties and such, while combining the two hairs.

~~~~ Texture Notes:

Nia's hair fuz seems to be some sort of opactiy trick, but im not entirely sure. If there is some sort of hair shader in your mod, use that rather than the inner, outer meshes.
