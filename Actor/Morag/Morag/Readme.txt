 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
I notice that normals with anythign that has a morph would be lost. If you use 3DS MAX use my .max. If you use blender, use the .fbx. Do not import an fbx into max or maya else you will lose normal data. Do not
try to rexport with Noesis, else you'd lose other data such as UV2's and UV3's, ETC.

~~~~ What I did:

Morag had seperate eyelashes and eyebrow meshes, which I felt could of easily fit onto the face texture, and thus make the face one whole texture. There was tones of extra space on the face texture, as the eyebrows
and eyelash texture was all 1 color anyways. The Face texture is edited to support this, including the DDS as well.

Since the face is merged that also means the morphs for everythign is on the face. 

~~~~ Texture Notes:

Nothing to note.
