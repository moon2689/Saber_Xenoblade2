Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.


What I did:

There is nothing special with Perun. She was re-exctracted to fix rigging issues, so right now she's as good as I currently know it as. 

Texture Notes:

Hairstrands glow a little differently, so consult game itself for ideas on how to make it look proper.
