 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
Please use the appropriate file. These models where prepaired in 3DS Max 2018, so .max will be perfect for Autodesk Programs, otherwise, the FBX should work fine for blender. Re-importing the fbx into 3DS Max
might make the custom normals be lost, so do your work at your own descretion. 

~~~~~~ Notes:

This model is similar to the Phantasm Boss. It uses a heavy darkness shader with red eyes to get off its effect, and the weapon used is just Mythra's weapon with the same shader over it.
