 Thank you for downloading!

Credit to PredatorCZ for the tool, it woulnd't be possible without him to get out the models of this quality.

Notice:
I notice that normals with anythign that has a morph would be lost. If you use 3DS MAX use my .max. If you use blender, use the .fbx. Do not import an fbx into max or maya else you will lose normal data. Do not
try to rexport with Noesis, else you'd lose other data such as UV2's and UV3's, ETC.

~~~~ What I did:

Dromarch was normal. I did make edits to the fur Fuzzes but I only extruded them outwards for the effect.

~~~~ Texture Notes:

Speaking of fur, in all honesty I have no idea how its done. I feel its extruded stuff, but I highly recommend you use some sort of heightmap based fur shader or some sort of fur shader rather than the furouter meshes.
